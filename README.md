# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Assignment Week 4

Within this repository you will find an R script called run_analysis.R, a codebook and a text file called Tidydataset.txt.

run_analysis.R extracts data from the website shown below and represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  This script cleans the data and creates a tidy dataset which can be used to perform further analysis.

Source of data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The codebook provides information on the data and fields included in the tidydataset as well as any transformations performed.

The Tidydataset.txt contains data which can be used to perform further analysis, it has been modified to contain one row for each subject activity performed with the mean and standard deviation measurement in the columns of the table.  
Importing Tidydataset: Data is delimited with a tab, text is represented using "".
